# CampJS VIII - The complex made simple with Event Sourcing 

This repo contains the example code snippets from my talk at this event. The slides [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kr-OMUBRakb9Zntuqi_NCaB_A-pDiQKU6_JjB7tQ-MQ/edit?usp=sharing).

The code is pulled from a live production application (and trimmed only for presentation clarity), which uses my Event Sourcing database solution: [Andvari](https://github.com/benoneal/andvari)

### Emails code examples

These examples illustrate my implementation of a full-featured email marketing solution. This includes subscription management, transactional emails, email campaigns, and behavioural emails.

### Data-driven features

These examples illustrate my implementation of a feature-testing/flagging suite, with support for cohort assignment, percentile-based rollout, data analysis, and critically, automated rollout/rollback of successful/harmful features.
